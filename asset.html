                <p class="sectionText1">Business intelligence is about ensuring
                    that your company’s employees and
                    management teams have the
                    information they need to do their jobs
                    effectively. DXC Business Intelligence for
                    Microsoft is a simple and accessible
                    solution that helps ensure that you
                    always have access to current, accurate
                    and relevant information that can be
                    used as a shared baseline on which to
                    base informed business decisions, and
                    define strategic direction.
                    You can integrate our solution with
                    Microsoft Power BI to provide
                    operational status on, for example,
                    monitors in your production facility or
                    warehouse areas, or you can embed a
                    dashboard into Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p>
