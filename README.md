The Challenge
Your task is to create two pages for the client.
The Landing Page
Your task is to create a landing page for DXC. The visitors will be directed to the landing page from sources such as LinkedIn.
DXC currently has given us 5 different white papers, or “assets”. Choose one of the assets and create a landing page that matches the target audience for that asset.

The landing page works as lead generation for DXC, so in order for the visitor to access the asset, DXC would like something in return, more specifically, information on the customer.

Set up a form that gathers relevant information about the user, and store the result in a database so DXC can later retrieve the data. If the user has already requested the asset, the user should be allowed to get it again, but the service should update the database to indicate a possible stronger lead.
The Asset Page
In order to improve readability (and allow access statistics) the asset itself should be re-created as HTML, CSS and JS. You should optimize the layout for reading on devices and laptops and follow the best practices from the web in general. Even though the PDF is “a single scrollable page” your implementation does not have to.
The asset page should not be accessible to visitors who have not filled in their information on the landing page. You decide how to best handle this situation.


The Solution
Your focus should be around UI, UX and the development of the site, but bear in mind that even changing the text of a button can have an impact and help the user reach a decision faster or in a more confident manner.

You should use a combination of all the skills gathered throughout the 1st, 2nd and 3rd semester to find and identify these areas.
These skills could include methods such as
User testing
Expert reviews
And anything else that can help get an insight

You can use the images, text, video etc from dxc.technology, the asset and the press kits  on your site.

You must create all other files, i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and content, yourself.

The solution must be on your own domain and your hand-in must contain a link to it.

Your hosted solution must be password protected
(use supplied solution from Fronter)
